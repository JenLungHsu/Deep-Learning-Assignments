## 📌 Description
1. **DL_HW1**
   - This assignment explores various classification models (KNN, SVM, Random Forest) combined with feature extraction techniques (SIFT, ORB, BRISK, ResNet18).
   - It includes detailed experiments on preprocessing and feature flattening effects on model performance.

2. **DL_HW2**
   - This assignment introduces a custom convolutional module designed to handle variable input channels, inspired by dynamic convolution concepts.
   - Additionally, a lightweight CNN architecture is constructed and tested on the ImageNet-mini dataset to achieve comparable results to ResNet34.
